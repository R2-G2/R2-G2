# **R2-G2**@**GitHub**

## Gists

Some *"projects"* are so small they aren't worth a full sized **Git** repository. Therefore I prefer to maintain them
using **Gists**. These don't support all usual features but still can be perfectly handled utilizing **Git**. For
simplicity's sake I tend to use `silent commits and reverts` for my `flat repositories`.

```shell
editor ~/.gitconfig
```

```gitconfig
[alias]
	silentcommit = commit --allow-empty-message -m ''
	silentrevert = revert --no-commit
```

- **[UN\*X setup](https://gist.github.com/R2-G2/b71248030139bc9648b4b712e25621d5)**: my basic **UN\*X** setup files
- **[Klipper.config](https://gist.github.com/R2-G2/a268aedda796dde8ce6c4ecc5b905a50)**: my
	**[Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper)** settings
- **[JavaScript fuck ups](https://gist.github.com/R2-G2/1e724699d4afb2315b2cc39987a6adfc)**: random **JavaScript**s of
	mine
